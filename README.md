# PKMS

A personal knowledge management system designed for privacy, portability, and flexibility.

## Core Principles

**Open Source** — Built transparently, licensed for freedom.

**Local-First** — Your data lives on your devices. Sync seamlessly between mobile and desktop without depending on cloud infrastructure.

**Portable** — Easy import/export ensures you're never locked in. Move to and from other PKMS tools freely.

**Access Control** — Granular permissions system for sharing and collaboration when you need it.
