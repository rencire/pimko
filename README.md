# PKMS

A personal knowledge management system designed for privacy, portability, and flexibility.

## Core Principles

**Open Source** - Built transparently, licensed for freedom.

**Local-First** - The application works entirely on your device without needing a network connection; sync is always optional.

**Data Sovereignty** - You have ultimate control over your data's location, with options to self-host or use our cloud for sync.

**Data Portability** - Easy import/export ensures you're never locked in. Move to and from other PKMS tools freely.

**Access Control** - Granular permissions system for sharing and collaboration when you need it.

**Interoperability** - Connect effortlessly with external tools and workflows.
